# FourthFruit LASER TAG

FourthFruit will shortly begin their LaserTag project. This project will aim to use the Raspberry Pi or Arduino to make fun laser tag guns. We will hopefully use old nerf guns for the casing but will also be making custom 3D-printed small side-arms if we can get the size down. If you have any ideas **PLEASE** tell them to us **IMMEDIATELY** we need good ideas such as what the best way to compute the procceses (ie. Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
